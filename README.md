Classification ML model to predict if the patients received metastatic cancer diagnosis within 90 days of screening.

Gilead Sciences is the sponsor for this yearâ€™s WiDS Datathon. They provided a rich, real-world dataset which contains information about demographics, diagnosis and treatment options, and insurance provided about patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer from 2015-2018. The dataset originated from Health Verity, one of the largest healthcare data ecosystems in the US. It was enriched with third party geo-demographic data to provide views into the socio economic aspects that may contribute to health equity. For this challenge, the dataset was then further enriched with zip code level toxicology data NASA/Columbia University.

The primary goal of building these models is to detect relationships between demographics of the patient with the likelihood of getting timely treatment. The secondary goal is to see if environmental hazards impact proper diagnosis and treatment.
